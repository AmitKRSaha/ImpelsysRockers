# AWS S3 as storage infrastructure

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context and Problem Statement

The Application developed for the The Road warrior system should be able to hold the data Securly, durably.

### Business Assumptions

* As the development team is a new startup, there would be budget constraints and it would require a quick way to store the appication data with easy configurations to scale 

## Decision drivers

* This is a Travel Management Application, The data should be highly available and reliable
* The Application and the data should be secured

## Decision

Leverage Amazons S3 as storage infrastructure 

__Reasons:__ 
* Scale storage resources to meet fluctuating needs with 99.999999999% (11 9s) of data durability.
* Store data across Amazon S3 storage classes to reduce costs without upfront investment or hardware refresh cycles.
* Protect your data with unmatched security, compliance, and audit capabilities.

### Consequences

* Data Transfer Costs: S3 charges for data transfer out of the storage service, which can add to your overall AWS bill
* Eventual Consistency: S3 provides eventual consistency for object updates, which means that under certain conditions, you might see outdated or stale data when accessing an object shortly after updating it. 
* Storage Class Transition Costs: Transitioning objects between storage classes (e.g., moving objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier) incurs additional costs and may require careful planning to optimize storage expenses.
